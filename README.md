# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
A HR analyst for Pewlett-Hackard (PH), Bobby, has been tasked with analyzing the number of current PH employees that meet the criteria to receive retirement packages. PH, being a long-running company, is facing a situation where a considerable portion of their employee base is reaching retirement and a large number of job openings will become open accordingly. To prepare for this “silver tsunami”, Bobby was asked to produce two deliverables: who exactly within PH will be retiring and how many open positions will need to be filled.

After creating an employee database in SQL to gather these results, Bobby presented his initial analysis and was asked to further expand on it. Besides the aforementioned deliverables, upper management would also like to see the number of retiring employees per title and the number of employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program. With this more well-rounded picture, PH will find itself in a more proactive state to effectively address the upcoming changes within their workforce.

## Analysis Results 

With the expanded analysis completed, there are four major points that can be identified:

•	The total number of current PH employees eligible for retirement packages is a staggering 90,398 employees.

•	The position that will be most impacted by the possible retirements is Senior Engineer with 29,414 eligible retirements and the position that will be least impacted is Manager with just 2 eligible retirements, as seen below:

•	While the retirements will heavily impact a large number of senior level positions, the highest position level in the corporate chain, Manager, will be virtually untouched. So, even with these substantial changes within the overall workforce, the upper management employee base will stay essential the same.

•	The number of current employees eligible for the mentorship program, those who were born in 1965, is 1,940 employees. As seen below, the particular positions with the greatest eligible mentors are Staff and Senior Manager:

## Analysis Results Summary

To present a clear picture to management about the substantial changes facing the PH workforce, the four previous bullet points can be summarized as answers to the following questions:

•	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 

   o A total of 90,398 position will need to be eventually filled. The specific role with the most open positions will be Senior Engineer, comprising 32.5% of all open positions. Yet, even with this large number of open positions, the current upper management workforce will stay mostly intact.

•	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees?

   o With the current criteria set forth to classify mentorship eligibility, there does not seem to be a big enough pool of possible mentors to mentor the new generation of PH employees. There are only 1,940 possible mentors within the current PH workforce in comparison to the 90,398 positions that will become open.  That will allow only 2.14% of the new employees to have a mentor. To further expanded the mentor pool, PH could consider adjusting the mentorship criteria so it further covers a larger number of current employees.
        
While these summaries complete out the deliverables as assigned by upper management, there are additional pieces of insights that could create an even more robust narrative about PH’s workforce changes. For example, if demographic data were able to be accessed, the retiring employees could be further grouped by specific demographic criteria. This could help determine PH if they should consider implementing diversity initiatives within this important, next-round of hiring. Another further insight would be to include the location data of each employee. Are employees who work at headquarters those most likely to retire? Or those who work at satellite offices? These questions could be answered if such data was made available.

With these analyses, PH should be able to take the proactive steps to ensure that the coming wave of retirements don’t negatively affect the company and a future itinerary has been mapped out if they would want to increase the granularity of the current findings.
