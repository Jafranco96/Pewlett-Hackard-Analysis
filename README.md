# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose

A HR analyst for Pewlett-Hackard (PW), Bobby, has been tasked with analyzing the number of current PW employees that meet the criteria to receive retirement packages. PW, being a long-running company, is facing a situation where a considerable portion of their employee base is reaching retirement and a large number of job openings will become open accordingly. To prepare for this “silver tsunami”, Bobby was asked to produce two deliverables: who exactly within PW will be retiring and how many open positions will need to be filled.

After creating an employee database in SQL to gather these results, Bobby presented his initial analysis and was asked to further expand on it. Besides the aforementioned deliverables, upper management would also like to see the number of retiring employees per title and the number of employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program. With this more well-rounded picture, PW will find itself in a more proactive state to effectively address the upcoming changes within their workforce.
